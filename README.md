# go.eport

Package eport provides a simple API to write Erlang ports in
Go. Currently line, packet and stream based ports are available for
use with arbitrary binaries. Sending and receiving arbitrary Erlang
terms over ports is a **work in progress** (see
https://github.com/ftrvxmtrx/go.etf).

For more information on Erlang ports see
http://www.erlang.org/doc/tutorial/c_port.html.
